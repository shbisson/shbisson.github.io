Technology journalist and writer, specialising in explainers and analytical features, writing about developer tools, technologies, and methodologies, with a focus on Microsoft and its platforms.

My writing builds on many years of experience as hardware developer, software developer, research engineer, CTO, systems architect, and technology strategy consultant.

I also write books.
